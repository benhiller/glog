TODO:
- Autoscrolling seems to have some bugs, doesn't keep up with pace of log messages -> autoscrolling gets disabled, animated scrolling seems to get stuck and loop
- Parse timestamp from log rather than using timestamp from glog
- Decrease default font size, remove/shrink header
- Add favicon (very important)
- Use React + virutalized library to render massive list of logs more efficiently?
