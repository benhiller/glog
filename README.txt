TODO:
- Decrease default font size
- Autoscroll doesn't consistently get enabled when scrolling to bottom
- Get rid of colors which have white text on colored background (more generally use my color settings?)
- Some logs have format: 'worker | job | log...'. Also parse job and allow filtering on that?
- Select all/unselect all for worker filter?
- Use React + virutalized library to render massive list of logs more efficiently?
- Set max number of messages stored to avoid using excessive memory
- Adjust scrollbar thumb color, hard to see currently
