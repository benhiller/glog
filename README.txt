TODO:
- Autoscrolling seems to have some bugs, doesn't keep up with pace of log messages -> autoscrolling gets disabled, animated scrolling seems to get stuck and loop
- Support regexes for filters
- Parse overmind log format and allow easily toggling on/off any of the processes.
- Parse timestamp from log rather than using timestamp from glog
- Decrease default font size, remove/shrink header
- Change from piping stdin to glog to instead have glog run the command and capture stdin + stderr?
- Add favicon (very important)
