TODO:
- Decrease default font size
- Autoscroll doesn't consistently get enabled when scrolling to bottom
- Some logs have format: 'worker | job | log...'. Also parse job and allow filtering on that?
- Select all/unselect all for worker filter?
- Use React + virutalized library to render massive list of logs more efficiently?
- Distribute on npm so people can just npm install + run 'glog ...'?
